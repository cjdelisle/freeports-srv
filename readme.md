# FreePorts Server

Status: stable+unmaintained, open an issue if you would like to take over

This is a server which will respond to any UDP packet on ANY PORT if it contains exactly the content
"FREEPORT". This is best used along with the [freeports client](https://github.com/cjdelisle/freeports).

To start this server:

    npm install
    sudo node ./server.js

That's all it is.
